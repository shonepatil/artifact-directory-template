Title:
Graph Neural Network Based Recommender Systems for Spotify Playlists

Abstract:
With the rise of music streaming services on the internet in the 2010’s, many have moved away from radio stations to streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. This shift offers more specificity and personalization to users’ listening experiences, especially with the ability to create playlists of whatever songs that they wish. Oftentimes user playlists have a similar genre or theme between each song, and some streaming services like Spotify offer recommendations to expand a user’s existing playlist based on the songs in it. Using Node2vec and GraphSAGE graph neural network methods, we set out to create a recommender system for songs to add to an existing playlist by drawing information from a vast graph of songs we built from playlist co-occurrences. The result is a personalized song recommender based not only on Spotify’s community of playlist creators, but also the specific features within a song.
